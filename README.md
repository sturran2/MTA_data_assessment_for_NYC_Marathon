# MTA_data_assessment_for_NYC_Marathon
This project assesses New York City Train data to find the station that shows the highest increase in users on marathon day. 

There are 3 files. There is a Word document and PowerPoint that summarizes the methods and the results of the assessments. There also is a Jupyter Notebook that documents all the programming that occured to come to the conclusion of this assessment. 

This assessment solves a fictional problem for Nesquik. It helps them identify the best New York station to advertise their flavored milk portfolio.
